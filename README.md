# soccer-betting-strategy

This repository forms the core of my master's thesis, where I'll be focusing on developing and applying a soccer match betting strategy. My approach involves a fusion of statistical analysis, machine learning techniques, and numerical optimization, primarily using Python as the main programming language. 

In addition to data-driven modeling, I'll also emphasize risk management. Advanced numerical optimization methods will be used to optimize betting portfolios, considering factors like bankroll management and risk tolerance. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a well-rounded approach to soccer betting that combines data science, statistical insights, and numerical techniques to make more informed and potentially profitable decisions.
